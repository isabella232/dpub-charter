This is the repository for the development of the [new charter](http://w3c.github.io/dpub-charter/index.html) for the [Digital Publishing IG @ W3C](http://www.w3.org/dpub/IG). The current charter expires in fall 2015; the goal is to finalize this charter and submit it to the W3C AC during summer 2015. You may also want to have a look at an accompanying document, the [EPUB+WEB White Paper](http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/), which has heavily influenced the work outlined in the new charter. You may also want to look at a [recent presentation](http://w3c.github.io/dpub/buchtage-2015/index.html?full#1) on the interest group's work which also gives a general outline of the work ahead.

At this point the charter is in a draft format, and is open for discussions, issues, comments, or questions to anybody who is interested. You can submit issues or comments using the [repository's issues list](http://w3c.github.io/dpub-charter/index.html).
